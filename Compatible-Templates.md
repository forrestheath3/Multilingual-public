## Compatible Templates ##

Squarespace templates are divided into different families. Families all share the same underlying code and structure. Individual templates within families are only distinguish by the applied style settings. This means if code works for one template in a family it will work for all of them since the underlying structure is shared.


The multilingual code has been tested on every family and works flawlessly on all but the pacific family templates. These ones requiresa minor tweak to work but we have it functioning as well.
